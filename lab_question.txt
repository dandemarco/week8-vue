This error occurs when a variable is being referenced inside your Vue template that doesn't exist outside of the Vue script. It can be 
"ignored" in the sense that this won't automatically cause your app to crash, but it will lead to a bug of some kind where an expected 
reaction will not occur. To fix it, make sure the variable in question has a counterpart in your component script.
